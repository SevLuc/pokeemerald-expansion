## Entries
- 2026-08-19 — QoL — Auto-heal after battle. New config flag `OW_HEAL_AFTER_BATTLE`
  (include/config/overworld.h, default TRUE) fully restores the party (HP, status,
  PP) after every won/ended wild, trainer, rematch, and scripted/legendary encounter,
  removing Pokémon Center trips. Excludes battle facilities (Frontier, Trainer
  Tower/Hill), link, Safari, recorded, and tutorial battles. Trade-off: removes
  battle-to-battle attrition as a difficulty lever. Verify in-game: after a normal
  wild/trainer fight the party is full HP/status/PP; inside Trainer Tower it is not.
- 2026-08-19 — config — EVs disabled game-wide. Player mons gain no EVs from
  battle (`B_EV_CAP_TYPE = EV_CAP_NO_GAIN`) or from vitamins/EV items
  (`B_EV_ITEMS_CAP = TRUE`) in include/config/caps.h; also fixed a malformed
  duplicate `B_EV_CAP_VARIABLE` define there. Removed the leftover EV spreads
  from the double-battle ally (src/data/battle_partners.party). Real trainers
  and gym leaders already had no EVs; debug_trainers.party left untouched.
- 2026-08-17 — setup — Project scaffolded from rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion
  (fork SevLuc/pokeemerald-expansion), FireRed target, CLAUDE.md + docs/ created.
  No gameplay changes yet; all config at expansion defaults.
